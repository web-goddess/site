> ##### Not bad for a muslin
> This was made as a toile, and although precision was used, some aspects could
> have been improved by using hand stitching, instead of machine stitching.
>
> Also, the pattern was printed with the standard `ease` of 1cm, and that 
> was taken in at the back seam after the pieces were cut out.
