## Brian is a block, not a pattern

A block is a basic shape on which other patterns are based.
They are sometimes also called slopers, although purists will argue that a block and a sloper are different things.

Point is, there is no point in providing instructions on how to make Brian.

That's because Brian is not supposed to be made as-is, but rather can serve as the basis for your own pattern designs.
