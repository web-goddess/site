title: Scope
pattern: draft
option: scope

This option allows you to draft the entire pattern (the default)
or to only draft certain patter parts.

This can be useful if you only need certain parts, or if you are making two variations
of the same pattern.

For example, if you're making a shirt with a different cuffs, you can draft one complete
pattern, and another that only includes the different cuffs.
