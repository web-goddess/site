title: Freesewing core fundamentals
---

Freesewing core is the platform that generates sewing patterns. 
To *get* it, here's a few things you should know:

## Concepts

There's a number of concepts that you should be familiar with to _get_ freesewing.

### The coordinate system

![The SVG coordinate system](/img/docs/core/fundamentals/coordinates.svg)

The coordinate system originates from the top left.

Coordinates are like text in a book. You start at the top on the left side,
and going to the right and downwards means going ahead.

On the X-axis, 30 is more to the right than 10, but less so than 40.

On the Y-axis, 15 is lower than 5, but higher than 50.

### Units

Internally, freesewing uses millimeter. When you see 1, that's one mm. When we say 7.8, that's 7.8mm.

Users can supply their measurements and options in imperial or metric, and in any shape they want (mm, cm, m).
It's the role of the channel to convert everything to mm for processing by core.

### SVG

Patterns are generated in SVG &mdash; short for Scalable Vector Graphics &mdash;, an XML-based vector image format and an open standard.

While you don't need to be an SVG expert, a basic understanding of the format will greatly help you to understand freesewing.

### Bezier curves

While lines on computers are easy to store with a start and end point, curves require more information.

In freesewing, and in SVG and countless of other IT applications, curves are stored as 
[Bezier curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve).
We use a start point, and end point, and two control points (one for the start point and one for the end point) to store bezier curves.

Bezier curves are more intuitive as you might think. I find this animation very helpful:

### Pathstrings

Pathstrings are a way to describe a path &mdash; made up of curves and/or line segments &mdash; in text.
In freesewing, we support the following operations in pathstrings:

- `M` : Move. The move operation moves to a specific point. Moving does not draw anything. It.s like moving across the paper without putting your pencil down.
- `L` : Line. The line operation draws a line from where we are now to a given point.
- `C` : Curve. The curve operation expect 3 point names. Two points that control the curve (so-called control points) and point at the curve endpoint.
- `Z` or `z` : Close path. This will close your path by drawing a line from wherever you are now to where your path started.

Paths **always** start with a M (move) operation. That is because all operations start from the current point.

For example, when drawing a line, you don't give it the start and the end point, but only the end point.
That's because, once again, all path operations start from the current point.

But when you start your path, there isn't a current point yet. So you start by moving to a point.

## Services
Freesewing core provides 4 different services. If the description below leaves you guessing,
you can try them all in [our demo](https://demo.freesewing.org/).

### The draft service
The draft service drafts patterns. It's sort of our main thing, and probably the reason you're reading this in the first place.

### The sample service
The sample service samples model measurements or pattern options.

A sample is a simplified version of the pattern that has just the seamlines.
The sample service can make such a simplified draft for a number of different models
(with different measurements) and stack them on top of each other.
This way, designers can check how their pattern adapts/grades to different sizes.

Or the sample service can use the same model, but itterate between the minimum and maximum
values of a given option. This way, you can check how the option impacts the pattern.

### The compare service
The compare service exists because people will miss-measure. It happens.

But when it does, it can be hard to know your pattern is wrong in the absence of
something to compare it to. That's where the compare service comes in.

It is a combination of the draft service and the sample service.
It will first create a stack of sampled drafts for standard models, and then stack your
own draft on top of that.

This way, you can simply eyeball your own pattern in comparison to a range of other models.

### The info service
The info service provides information about the core platform. It serves to facilitate 
frontend integration.
As such, it's mostly relevant to developers and site builders.

[Our demo](https://demo.freesewing.org/) uses the info service. It doesn't know what patterns we have, or what options each
pattern has. But it doesn't have to, it can simply ask the info service.

## Building blocks

Core has different modules that work together.

### Patterns

A **pattern** generates a _draft_ based on the measurements and options provided by the user.

In other words, the pattern does the heavy lifting of taking user input and transforming that
into something useful.

Patterns are single-purpose. They generate drafts, that's all they do.

### Themes

A **theme** controls the look and feel - the way a draft is displayed. Its role is two-fold:

 - Format the draft 
 - Format the response

Formatting the draft is (hopefully) self-explanatory. The theme controls the 
colours of lines, fonts of the text, logos, and what notches and other patterns markings look like.

But themes can also format the request. For example, you could create a theme that doesn't
return the standard SVG, but turns that automatically in a PDF.

> ##### Should I care about themes?
> If you're (thinking about) using freesewing to power your pattern company, you will want to make a theme
> to make your patterns look like your patterns. Colours, line types, fonts, logo, and so on.
>
> If not, you can mostly forget about themes.

### Channels

Channels currently handle unit conversions and access control.
The will be removed in future versions of core, and you can largely ignore them.
