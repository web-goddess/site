title: Core documentation

**Core** is the heart of freesewing. It is the  *open source platform for made-to-measure sewing patterns* that this is all about.

If you are new to core, you should start by reading about [core fundamentals](/docs/core/fundamentals).

The [core API documentation](/docs/core/api) details all the methods that you can use to design your patterns.
However, you may find you need nothing more but our [API cheat sheet](/cheatsheet.pdf).
