## Code of conduct

Freesewing strives to be an open and inclusive community.

As a contributor, you are expected to uphold it.

## Where to get help or report a problem

meet other freesewers, or just hang out and share a laugh.
- Chat not your thing? The [@freesewing_org](https://twitter.com/freesewing_org) 
Twitter account is the next best thing.
- Did you spot a mistake? Have a suggestion for an improvement? 
Please [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/freesewing/site/issues/new). 
You'll need a GitHub account, but they are free.
