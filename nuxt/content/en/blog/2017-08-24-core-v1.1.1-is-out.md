## Changes 

### New

 - New and not new: [Bruce](/patterns/bruce) is completely redesigned from scratch
 - The [`Pattern::setOptionIfUnset`](/docs/core/classdocs/patterns/core/pattern#setoptionifunset) and 
[`Pattern::setValueIfUnset`](/docs/core/classdocs/patterns/core/pattern#setvalueifunset) methods allow child patterns to override options and values
 - The [`Pattern::stretchToScale`](/docs/core/classdocs/patterns/core/pattern#stretchtoscale) method makes stretch options more intuitive
 - The [`Part::circlesCross`](/docs/core/classdocs/src/part#circlescross) and 
[`Part::circleCrossesLine`](/docs/core/classdocs/src/part#circlecrossesline) methods find intersections of circles and lines
 - The [`Part::shiftOutwards`](/docs/core/classdocs/src/part#shiftoutwards), 
[`Part::shiftFractionTowards`](/docs/core/classdocs/src/part#shiftfractiontowards), and 
[`Part::shiftFractionAlong`](/docs/core/classdocs/src/part#shiftfractionalong) methods are additional shift helper methods
 - The [`Utils::constraint`](/docs/core/classdocs/src/utils#constraint) method is new. It deals with input validation for options
 - Pattern config files have new data used by the frontend, including `handle`, `tags` and a `title`, `description`, and `group` for options. Only impacts the frontend
 - Pattern config files also have conditional options, using `dependsOn` and `onlyOn` in the options config. Only impacts the frontend
 - The info service will hide all pattern parts that have a title starting with a `.` character
 - PHP error output is now disabled in index.php so we don't have to trust the server config
 - Added the frontend draft handle to the Core theme so that the frontend reference is printed on the pattern
 - The standard theme has a new `various` path CSS class
 - Added support for custom seam allowance to [the Freesewing channel](/docs/core/classdocs/channels/core/freesewing) and to all patterns
 - The `NotationLegend` pattern in the `Docs` namespace is new. It's used to document [the pattern notation](/docs/patterns/notation).

### Changes

 - Removed all beta patterns from the core repository
 - Changes to the deploy script and Travis configuration
 - Changed the `sleeveLengthToWrist` measurement to [shoulderToWrist](/docs/measurements/shouldertowrist)
 - Changed the [`Pattern::setOption`](/docs/core/classdocs/patterns/core/pattern#setoption) method to 
[`Pattern::setOptionIfUnset`](/docs/core/classdocs/patterns/core/pattern#setoptionifunset) in all patterns
 - Part titles no longer use CSS transforms as they turned out to be unreliable when rendered by the browser or as PDF
 - Added the `freesewing` class to SVG output to avoid style collisions
 - Simplified the logo
 - Updated the apigen config for the auto-generated class documentation
 - The [`Part::newTextOnPath`](/docs/core/classdocs/src/part#newtextonpath) method takes an extra `$renderPath` parameter
 - Simon's back is cut on the fold now, reducing the pattern's print size

#### Brian

 - The range of the `sleevecapHeight` options has been tweaked
 - The `shoulderSlope` option is now configurable. (also caused minor changes in Aaron, Sven and Wahid)

#### Bruce
 - Changed `stretchFactor` options to `stretch`

#### Cathrin

 - Now uses `hipsCircumference` as measurement, like other patterns (was `hips`)
 - Now uses `naturalWaistToHip` as measurement, like other patterns (was `naturalWaistToHips`)

#### Simon

 - Removed `backNeckCutout` option
 - Changed to more sensible defaults for ease options

#### Theo & Theodore

 - Renamed the `waistbandRise` option to `backRise`
 - Renamed the `bodyRise` option to `seatDepth`

#### Wahid

 - Updated the (faulty) cutting instructions for the front

### Fixes

 - Bug fix in the [`Utils::lineLineIntersection`](/docs/core/classdocs/src/utils#linelineintersection) method when dealing with parallel lines
 - Fixed incorrect release date for v1.0.0 in the changelog

#### Simon

 - Fixed faulty part number on the sleeve part
 - The `shoulderSlope` option was incorrectly set to `measure`, rather than `angle`
 - Fixed issue with cuff drape and nr of pleats

#### Theo & Theodore

 - Both patterns now take the `lengthBonus` option into account
